# Python Refresher ðŸš€
This repository contains my Python refresher exercises.  
So far Iâ€™ve uploaded the **Basics**, and I will gradually add **NumPy, Pandas, Visualization, and ML** in the coming days.  

Goal: To refresh my programming skills and prepare for projects in **Medical Informatics & AI in Radiology**.

# NumPy Refresher

This folder contains exercises with **NumPy**:
- Creating arrays
- Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation
- Reshaping arrays (1D â†’ 2D)

The goal is to practice working with numerical data before moving on to **Pandas** and more advanced data analysis.
