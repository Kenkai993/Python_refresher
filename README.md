# Python Refresher ðŸš€
This repository contains my Python refresher exercises.  
So far Iâ€™ve uploaded the **Basics**, and I will gradually add **NumPy, Pandas, Visualization, and ML** in the coming days.  

Goal: To refresh my programming skills and prepare for projects in **Medical Informatics & AI in Radiology**.
